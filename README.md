Curae is a mobile application that aids those who have been displaced from their homes whether it be from natural disasters or war. This application eliminates the need of outside organizations, and replaces it with a strong system based on giving. When we see heartbreaking natural disasters or the struggles of refugees, we all want to help, but are limited with the aid we can provide. We know that humakind cares, it’s in our nature to care. With Curae people are given a platform to aid others no matter the cause, because kindness is the best form of humanity.
