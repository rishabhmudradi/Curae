# Curae
Curae is a mobile application that aids those who have been displaced from their homes whether it be from natural disasters or war. This application eliminates the need for outside organizations and replaces it with a strong system based on care. When we witness heartbreaking natural disasters or the struggles of refugees, we all want to provide some form of help but are limited to the aid we can provide. We know that humankind cares, it’s in our nature to care. With Curae orginizations and community members are given a platform to aid others no matter the cause, because kindness is the best form of humanity.
